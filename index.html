        <p>Have you ever been asked to write "better" code, design, tests, or other aspects of software? What qualifies
            as "better" is the subject of a vast number of books, acronyms, tools, and opinions. Continuously gathering,
            evolving, internalizing, and applying "better" is a vast effort. What if there was a way to shortcut that
            effort?
        </p>
        <p>The belief (and experiment) of GFBS is that working toward <strong>a minimal set of goals will cause the majority of
            "better" practices to emerge as a byproduct</strong>. A set of exercises for each goal will help to close the gap
            between reality and the goal. The exercises will also let us know the distance to the goal, and can spark
            great conversations within a team.
        </p>

        <p>GFBS is an experiment, and is meant to evolve over time. Found something useful? Unclear? Have ideas
            for
            improvements? Please send your thoughts to Aaron Silinskas (<a
