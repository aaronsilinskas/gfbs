        <p>
            <strong>Software development is a craft.</strong> We incrementally improve as we learn from our own
            experience and the experience of others to build that next piece of software. There is no "best", because
            <strong>there is always "better"</strong>. What qualifies as "better" is the subject of a vast number of
            books, acronyms, tools, and opinions. Propagating this knowledge is traditionally very time consuming, and a
            real challenge to scale to the needs of teams and organizations.
        </p>
        <p>The hypothesis of GFBS is that working toward <strong>a minimal set of goals will cause the majority of
            "better" software development practices to emerge as a byproduct</strong>. A set of experiments will help to
            close the gaps between goals and reality. The experiments will also let us know the distance to the goal,
            and can spark great conversations within a team.
        </p>

        <blockquote>"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly
            reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it
            easier to write.", Robert C. Martin, Clean Code
        </blockquote>

        <p>We choose names for classes, functions, variables, etc to communicate knowledge and intent. <strong>Better
            names are more quickly and easily understood by a larger audience</strong>. Conversely, worse names require
            more time and experience to understand. As Uncle Bob suggests, we should optimize reading because that is
            where we spend the majority of our time. The size of the audience is important because it is easier to scale
            the number of contributors with a larger pool.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="better-code-naming-ex-1" class="anchor" href="#better-code-naming-ex-1" aria-hidden="true"><span
                aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experiment: Widen The Audience</h3>
        <p>
            We want to learn how much time and experience is needed to understand a piece of code. <strong>Junior
            developers are the best collaborators</strong> because their feedback is the most likely to increase the
            size of the audience. In-person or video conferencing works best because facial expressions, body language,
            and muttered or exclaimed wtf's are often filtered when using text-based tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pair up with a collaborator and sit down with your code. <strong>Ask them to explain what the code is doing
            and why.</strong> Unless the person is completely stuck, <strong>listen and do not guide them!</strong>
            Misunderstandings and insights often show areas for improvement where we can choose better names for
            classes, functions, and variables, etc.

        <p>
            <i>TODO:</i> fastest is the compiler not allowing invalid use, next is exceptions ASAP. Don't allow invalid
            objects. Bounds checks are critical.

            Experiments - Can an object exist in an invalid state? If so, how many places in the code have to deal with
            it? These are bugs waiting to happen.
