        <p>
            <strong>Software development is a craft.</strong> We incrementally improve as we learn from our own
            experience and the experience of others to build that next piece of software. There is no "best", because
            <strong>there is always "better"</strong>. What qualifies as "better" is the subject of a vast number of
            books, acronyms, tools, and opinions. Propagating this knowledge is traditionally very time consuming, and a
            real challenge to scale to the needs of teams and organizations.
        </p>
        <p>The hypothesis of GFBS is that working toward <strong>a minimal set of goals will cause the majority of
            "better" software development practices to emerge as a byproduct</strong>. A set of exercises will help to
            close the gaps between goals and reality. The exercises will also let us know the distance to the goal, and
            can spark great conversations within a team.

        <blockquote>"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly
            reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it
            easier to write.", Robert C. Martin, Clean Code
        </blockquote>

        People use code to communicate with machines, but it also communicates with people. We communicate knowledge and
        intent by naming. We fail fast to let people know about problems as soon as possible.

        <strong>Naming</strong> - critical to all code, whether tests, implementation, etc.

        Exercises - Capture insights - when code is unclear and we gain new insights, the best place to capture those
        insights is in the code. - Code is never done - get review from all skill levels


        <strong>Fail Fast</strong> - Fail fast - fastest is the compiler not allowing invalid use, next is exceptions
        ASAP. Don't allow invalid objects. Bounds checks are critical.

        Exercises - Can an object exist in an invalid state? If so, how many places in the code have to deal with it?
        These are bugs waiting to happen.
